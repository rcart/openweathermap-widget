# Basic weather App

It uses [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) to retrieve weather info and icons. This app was originally intented to be used with [Underground Weather](https://www.wunderground.com/), but the free API was cancelled some time ago.

This app uses localStorage to persist location data.

TODO: Review code, fix this README and check for improvements
